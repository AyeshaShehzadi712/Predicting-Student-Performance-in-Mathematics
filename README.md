The objective of this project is to build and compare two binary classifiers for predicting
student performance in Mathematics, using the data collected from two public schools in Portugal
during the school year 2005/06. The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle. The descriptive features
include 5 numeric, 17 nominal and 10 ordinal features. The target feature, G3, is a numeric variable,
which shows the final grade. The values of G3 range from 0 to 20, where 0 represents the lowest
grade while 20 represents full marks. For a binary classification, G3 values that are greater or equal
to 10 represent ”Pass”, else ”Fail”.
